# SOLID Principles in Python

This repository demonstrates the application of SOLID principles in Python. SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## What are SOLID Principles?

SOLID stands for:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design and architecture.
